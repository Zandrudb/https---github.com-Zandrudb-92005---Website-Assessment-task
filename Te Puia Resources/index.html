          <h1>Geothermal Valley</h1>
          <p>There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley in Rotorua.
            Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity that remains today.

        <h1>National Weaving school</h1>
        <p>The original weaving school – Te Whare Raranga – was established in 1969, shortly after the carving school. It was run by New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute’s first employed weaving tutor, internationally renowned weaver, Emily Schuster (QSM, OBE). Te Rito was built in 1994. At this school, male and female students have the honour of learning traditional Māori weaving techniques, as taught by experienced tutors.Tauira (students) within Te Rito learn the art and skills of traditional weaving, upholding the Māori tradition for future generations.
          Today, Te Rito is led by Tumu, Meleta Bennett- who was mentored by Emily Schuster’s daughter, Edna Pahewa. Edna was the Tumu of Te Rito for 18 years prior to Meleta’s appointment.  Through Edna’s influence, Meleta’s role as Tumu is ensuring the time-honoured art form lives on for the next generation.

        <h1>National Wood Carving school</h1>
        <p>Since the first intake at Te Wānanga Whakairo, many young Māori from iwi (tribes) throughout New Zealand have been taught the Māori practice of wood carving under the expert guidance of master carvers who were once trainees at the school.
          In 1967, seven carving apprentices were selected from throughout the country to train under master carver Hone Te Kauru Taiapa – a student of the first Wānanga Whakairo. Part of that 1967 group are present day New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute master carvers, Clive Fugill and James Rickard. The school has been located in Te Whakarewarewa Valley since 16 January 1967, but it was initially established after legislation was passed in 1926 to preserve Māori arts and crafts, under the auspices of prominent Māori politician and lawyer Sir Apirana Ngata.

          <h1>National Stone and Bone Carving school</h1>
          <p>At Te Takapū, students learn the revered tradition of carving pounamu (Nephrite-Jade/Greenstone), bone and stone. The school opened on 5 October 2009, expanding on NZMACI’s commitment to maintaining, developing and promoting the arts, crafts and culture of iwi Māori (Māori tribes) as mandated by the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Act (1963) (History). The school was first led by Lewis Gardiner who is a well-regarded pounamu artist of his generation. Stacy Gordine, a renowned artist from the East Coast of New Zealand – and uri of Hone Te Kauru and Pine Taiapa – now leads the programme and is shaping the direction of the wānanga into the future.

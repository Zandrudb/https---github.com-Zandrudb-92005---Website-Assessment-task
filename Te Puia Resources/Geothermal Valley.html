              <h1>Pohutu Geyser</h1>
              <p>Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods. To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).

        <p>The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.
            Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting boiling water and steam into the air. All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system. As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the earth’s surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water. The water is under significant pressure causing the boiling point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius. As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved by violently shooting steam and water into the air with tremendous force.

            <h1>Mud Pool</h1>
            <p>Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that are used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. Māori traditionally used the mud to treat stomach infections by mixing a small amount with water and drinking it. infections by mixing a small amount with water and drinking it. Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot water, but abundant supplies of steam and rock. That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide released by geothermal features. When released into the air, the hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This acid has the ability to dissolve rock into fine particles of silica and clay, and when combined with a small supply of water, a mud pool is created.

      <p>The Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other beauty products is sourced from mud pools about ten times the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. You can purchase some of these products from Te Puia’s Gift Shop. The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black sulphur turns it to grey. The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit). This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” because of the similarity between the plopping mud and leaping frogs.
